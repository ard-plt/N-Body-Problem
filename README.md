# Gravity and Rocket Simulation

A simple 2D gravitational simulation with support for both massive objects and rockets with fuel-based thrust mechanics.

This project demonstrates:
- Newtonian gravity between objects
- Rocket propulsion with fuel consumption
- Energy tracking (kinetic + potential)
- Basic vector math operations
- Custom drawing output via a canvas-like interface

## Features

- ðŸš€ Add multiple objects and rockets interactively
- ðŸ“ˆ Simulate gravitational interactions step-by-step
- ðŸ’¥ Rocket thrust based on fuel mass and exhaust velocity
- ðŸ§® Real-time total energy output for conservation analysis
- ðŸŽ¨ Visualize object positions frame by frame
